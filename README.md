# LiveImage

Manual creation of character animations using traditional tools is tedious and cumbersome for a novice animator. Video-to-image motion retargeting emerges as an automated approach for animating an input image using an exemplar video. State-of-the-art animation methods often produce artifacts in presence of drastic pose changes within a video. To address this issue, we propose LiveImage, which handles the large pose problem and overcomes various artifacts and shape distortions in the generated video frames. LiveImage utilize a single-domain motion model with keypoint regularization first to produce coarse-grained frames that effectively capture motion and structural information. A motion condition network then estimates fine-grained video frames using denoising diffusion model to counteract unnatural artifacts and distortions arising from large pose changes. Our proposed methodology undergoes comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming challenges associated with motion transfer from video to image.
